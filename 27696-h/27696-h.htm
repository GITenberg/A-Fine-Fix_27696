beings are fine buck-passers&mdash;but

<p>The leader climbed sharply in a
bank to the left, and the two others
followed close behind. Their jet
streams cut off at very near the same
time. Before their speed slowed to
stalling, the rotors unfolded from
the canopy hump and beat the air
viciously, the steam wisping back in
brief fingers.</p>

<p>Under power again, they dipped
playfully in tightening circles toward
the plot-mottled earth. The
fields expanded beneath them, and
the leader brought up and hovered
over a farm road whose dust already
stirred in the disturbed air.</p>

<p>They settled as one in the rolling
dust clouds from which emerged a
coveralled figure who had driven the
battered pickup truck to meet them.</p>

<p>"Y'sure got back in a rush," he
addressed the major, who was just
jumping from the plastiglas cabin.</p>

<p>The major nodded and put his
attention on seeing that the general
descended safely. He then indicated
the farmer.</p>

<p>"He's the one," the major said.</p>

<p>The general grunted socially.</p>

<p>Taking the opening, the farmer
said, "Out there in the wheat, general."
His tone carried eager importance.
"My kid saw the light
come down this morning feedin' the
chickens. I felt the ground jump,
too. Called the sheriff, first off."</p>

<p>"All right, you were a hero," said
the general shortly. "Now, Grant,
will you take me to it? I can't mess
around here all day."</p>

<p>The party of six men, two of
them technicians, waded into the
field from the road. The farmer remained
to watch, frowning.</p>

<p>When they had progressed well
into the wheat, he shouted after them
ruefully, "And watch where you're
steppin', too!"</p>

<p>The group paused on the rim of
newly gouged earth, clods and dirt
that had splashed from the center
of the crater. It was nearly four feet
deep. The man the major had left
on guard had uncovered more of the
blackened object, which lay three-quarters
exposed and showed a
warped but cylindrical shape.</p>

<p>"Let's have a counter on it," the
general ordered.</p>

<p>A technician slid into the crater
and swept the metal with his instrument.
The needle swung far over
and stuck.</p>

<p>To the other technician the general
said, "Get a chunk for verification
of the alloy." He kicked a
small avalanche of dirt down the
crater side and turned back to the
road, adding, "Although I don't
know why the formality. Even a
cadet could see that's an atomjet
reactor, beat up as it is."</p>

<p>The major absorbed the jibe without
comeback. An hour ago he had
informed the general of his indecision
over the object's identity,
though he had suspected it to be
the reactor.</p>

<p>"We may find more when we get
it examined in the shop," the general
mused, swishing by the wheat.
"But at least we know they do come
down some place, and it wasn't flash
fusion. On this one, anyway."</p>

<p>"What do you think about instituting
a search of this vicinity for
other parts, general?"</p>

<p>The officer growled negatively.
"Obviously, the reactor was the only
part not vaporized in the fall&mdash;because
of its construction."</p>

<p>"That's assuming the ship entered
the atmosphere at operational velocity
and not less than free fall," the
major qualified.</p>

<p>"How can anyone assume free
fall? Way outside probability."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but there are degrees
of velocity involved. He could have
used reverse thrust and entered at
a relatively slow speed."</p>

<p>"All right, all right&mdash;let's say
possible, then. Pull off your search
if you want to. I'm in this thing
so deep now, I'll try anything to get
going. I've got Congress ready to
investigate, and some senator yesterday
put pressure on to cancel the
United Nuclear contract. I'll try anything
at this point, Grant!"</p>

<p>The big man's voice had risen
to anger, but Major Grant Reis had
not missed the vocal breaking in
the last syllables.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I'm First Lieutenant Ashley and
I've an appointment to see General
Morrison."</p>

<p>The adjutant said, "Sorry, but
you'll have to wait a little longer.
The general's unexpectedly busy."</p>

<p>"My appointment was over an
hour ago."</p>

<p>"Another half-hour and you can
go in."</p>

<p>"Another half-hour and I'll go."</p>

<p>"It's your bar."</p>

<p>The lieutenant plopped back into
a chair just as Grant strode swiftly
past the adjutant's desk from the
private office.</p>

<p>"Major," the adjutant asked,
"how long is the general going to
be tied up? He won't let me in the
conference and the lieutenant here
is supposed to see him."</p>

<p>Grant paused at the opposite door
and pointing two thumb-and-forefinger
guns at his head exploded
them. The adjutant groaned understandingly.
Even the first lieutenant
caught on.</p>

<p>"Major, it's pretty important," the
waiting officer said, standing again.
Grant shifted his attention.</p>

<p>"Look, lieutenant&mdash;" Grant bottled
the sarcasm behind his suddenly
lax mouth. He saw a first lieutenant's
uniform, but it bulged
aesthetically; and he saw a first lieutenant's
cap and bar, but it sat
rakishly on puffed-up brown curls.</p>

<p>"If you'll just look at these papers,
major, you'll understand. I stratoed
in from the Pentagon this morning,"
she said crisply.</p>

<p>Though it was Grant's turn to
say something, he found too much
of his concentration on her challenging
brown eyes and the efficient
down-sweep of her half-pouting
mouth, plus a nub of a nose that
pointed proudly upwards with the
tilt of her head. In a temporary
defensive maneuver, Grant took the
papers handed him.</p>

<hr />

<p>The borders were marked CONFIDENTIAL
and the attached signatures
would have impressed even
the general. The subject&mdash;he might
have expected&mdash;ATOMJET PATROL
LOSSES.</p>

<p>"Er ... look, lieutenant&mdash; What
was it?" Grant glanced down at the
papers.</p>

<p>"First Lieutenant Bridget Ashley."</p>

<p>"Look, Lieutenant Ashley, the
general's been getting nothing but
troubles all day. For your sake and
his sake, I suggest you come back
tomorrow, huh?" Grant handed back
the papers and put a hand on her
elbow, but she jerked back.</p>

<p>"Major, I've been given a great
deal of responsibility in this assignment,"
she flared, "and it's important
for me to get work started at
once. I was led to understand these
patrol losses constituted a fairly
urgent matter."</p>

<p>Grant glanced ominously toward
the general's door. "Lieutenant, I'm
trying to explain to you that it's in
your best interests to take this up
with him tomorrow. I'm one of his
aides and I know him. I realize
you're authorized to see him today,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I'll wait." She reseated
herself and emphatically crossed her
legs&mdash;a motion not escaping Grant's
notice.</p>

<p>The adjutant and Grant mutually
shrugged at each other, and Grant
headed outside, saying over his
shoulder, "I'll be back in a minute."</p>

<hr />

<p>As it developed, it was far more
than a minute; but whatever it was,
when Grant returned she was gone.
The major looked at the adjutant,
and the adjutant indicated the general's
door with an apprehensive
nod. Grant bit his lip and entered
the private office.</p>

<p>He had expected to hear the general's
bass raging, but through the
inner door came the strident tones
of the lieutenant's modulating contralto.
He had expected to see the
general towering over the girl's
shrinking figure, but as he entered
she was bent earnestly in the middle,
and the top of her torso inclined
toward General Morrison, who had
tilted as far back as his swivel chair
would permit.</p>

<p>"... So, if you haven't isolated
any mechanical causation, how can
you be sure it's mechanical?" she
was laying it on. "And if you're not
sure it's mechanical, how can you
suggest there's no possibility of psychological
causation? The authorities
that sent me here have not only
considered the possibility, they feel
it's quite probable. All I am requesting,
sir, is immediate implementation
of my authority so your
investigation can be broadened. It's
really to your benefit that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grant said, "Lieutenant Ashley."</p>

<p>"... My work be started at once
so as to catch up on what findings
you have obtained in the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grant shouted, "Lieutenant Ashley!"</p>

<p>"... Investigation so far in the
mechanical aspects. It's not unlikely
that a combining factor, both psychological
and mechanical&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grant yelled, "LIEUTENANT
ASHLEY!!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, major."</p>

<p>"Would you please wait in the
outer office for just a moment?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For just a moment, lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Grant waited until the door closed
before he tried communication with
the general. The officer still teetered
in his chair, his eyes bulging from
his reddened face.</p>

<p>"They sent me a shape," he sputtered.
"That I could take. Shapes I
don't mind, even with authority. But
this one&mdash; You know where she's
from, Grant?"</p>

<p>Grant sighed hopelessly.</p>

<p>"She's from syk," the general was
beginning to roar, "with a blank
check of authority from Washington.
She stood there and called the losses
pilot-error. My pilots, Grant, the
ones I trained!"</p>

<p>"Just a possibility, she meant,"
soothed Grant.</p>

<p>"Possibility, hell! With that attitude
around Mojave we'll never get
anywhere in this investigation." He
untilted with a crash. "I want her
kept away from me, do you hear?
Give her anything she wants&mdash;but
appointments with me. I've got
United Nuclear here for stress tests,
coolant analyses, radiation metering
in the morning just as a start, and
I'm not going to have that shape
around fusing up the works."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do, sir."</p>

<p>"You're right you will. I'm putting
Colonel Sorenson in as G-2,
and you're going to be the new Syk
Co&ouml;rdinator for the duration of this
investigation!"</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"You heard me."</p>

<p>"It couldn't be that bad, general,"
Grant grumbled.</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Baby-sitting."</p>

<p>The general stood up from his
desk. "No, you'll relay any data she
may turn up to me, and you'll see
she gets what supplies and personnel
she may need. Look, Washington
thinks we need her, so I take orders.
And so do you, Grant. I'll have a
special order out this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Grant saluted and
wheeled, grinding his molars.</p>

<hr />

<p>With dubious explanations, Grant
managed to steer Lieutenant Ashley
toward the Officers' Club. What
excuses he gave her evidently had
some effect; after the first fifty yards
across the drill ground she steered
easily, though still under vocal
protest.</p>

<p>A drink, and Grant felt he could
face the future. They sat in a plastiweave
booth, one against the far
wall that overlooked through a
curved window the blasting circle.</p>

<p>So wrapped up with his own
feelings, Grant had been unaware
of his companion's. Her face had
paled, and she stirred her drink
absently. The reflections in her eyes
were over-bright with moisture.</p>

<p>Offered Grant: "The general has
a lot on his mind."</p>

<p>"Yeah," she choked.</p>

<p>"The losses have upset him pretty
bad."</p>

<p>"I notice. Me, too."</p>

<p>"Take a drink."</p>

<p>She sipped one CC and said, "And
syk upsets him."</p>

<p>Grant smiled, "And shapes."</p>

<p>"And I suppose the rank of first
lieutenant makes him nervous."</p>

<p>"No," Grant chuckled, "he can
take or leave that. It's majors that
get him."</p>

<p>She smiled vaguely, so Grant followed
up with: "What's your background?"</p>

<p>"Psychometrics. Got a doctorate
in it. I thought it might be valuable
to the Air Force&mdash;at one time." She
sipped two CCs.</p>

<p>"I've a little syk background,"
Grant said. She looked up in sudden
interest. "Started to major in it
until I ran up against some of the
profs. If this is what syk produces,
I decided, it's not for me. Changed
to engineering then. Unfortunately,
the general knows about my record."</p>

<p>"How did he take it out on you,
parade duty?"</p>

<p>"Worse. He made me an aide."</p>

<p>The girl leaned on an elbow and
regarded him with her chin in her
hand. "You bring his slippers?"</p>

<p>"As G-2, I did up until quarter
of an hour ago. I've been promoted.
Meet the Base Mojave Syk Co&ouml;rdinator."</p>

<p>Putting her nose in her drink,
she giggled softly. "What is it he
wants co&ouml;rdinated, the syk or me?"</p>

<p>"You're on bearing," he laughed.
"My name's Grant."</p>

<p>His hand went across the table,
opened, and waited.</p>

<p>"Bridget," she said, and her hand
fell into his in a handshake which
lingered slightly.</p>

<hr />

<p>At Grant's insistence they jeep-toured
the base. To his surprise
Bridget took interest in the installations,
but asked most of her questions
around the atomjet hangars.</p>

<p>"I've never seen one close," she
hinted.</p>

<p>Grant flashed his Security card at
the guards and they went in. She
strolled about the tapering, snub-winged
craft, apparently inspecting
it closely. Grant's thought was that
she felt she had to dramatize understanding
something about Air Force
rocketry.</p>

<p>After a short silence Bridget
asked, "What is the compensating
factor for the reactor's being placed
off the center of stability?"</p>

<p>Grant blinked. "What's that
again?"</p>

<p>She swung a pointed finger at the
ship. "Naturally," she interrupted,
"the nose will float downward in
the canal, hoisting the hot tubes out
of the liquid at the end of the glide-ins.
But you've got pilot, power
plant, and wings frontside. How can
you affect glide-ins at surface air
density without nosing in?"</p>

<p>The major decided she must have
been reading the latest confidential
files. High-viscosity liquid landing
canals constituted a subject recent
enough to be Security and important
enough not to be bandied about
outside engineering and Base
Mojave.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," Grant cleared
his throat, "there're the fuel tanks
along the back of the blast chamber,
partly lead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The tanks usually are nearly
empty for glide-ins," she reminded.</p>

<p>Grant frowned. "Yes, usually empty,
but still a weight factor. Then
there's the automatic wing stabilizer
that adjusts to the air speed and
density and acts to pull up the
nose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O.K.," she interrupted. "Now,
would you lift me through the
canopy, please? I'd like to sit inside
a minute."</p>

<p>"That's out," he said. "Only pilots
and technicians."</p>

<p>"All right, if you won't, I'll get
up myself." She marched over to the
hangar wall and pulled over boarding
steps, which were braced on
three pivotal tires.</p>

<p>"Bridget, Security says pilots and
mechanics."</p>

<p>"And you're forgetting why I'm
here, and besides that you're supposed
to co&ouml;rdinate. Right now
you're unco&ouml;rdinating."</p>

<hr />

<p>Before Grant's eyes flashed the
memory of her orders with the signatures
at the bottom. She was already
climbing the steps.</p>

<p>"Just don't touch anything, that's
all," he conciliated, following her
up. Her seams were straight, he
noted.</p>

<p>Bridget thudded into the narrow
pilot's seat and wiggled herself into
a comfortable position.</p>

<p>"Awful crowded," she smiled up
at Grant.</p>

<p>"I hope you tore your nylons,"
he groused.</p>

<p>"Now, if you'll just explain these
gadgets," she said, moving her hand
over the panel embedded with digit-rimmed
dials.</p>

<p>"Hands off, please."</p>

<p>"By your reaction, I would say
you don't know what some of them
are," she counter-fired, and tossed
her protruding bunch of curls.</p>

<p>Grant took the bait. He leaned
into the canopy and with an over-stiffened
index finger pointed forcefully
at each gauge. For more than
a quarter-hour this went on, with
Bridget pitching questions&mdash;most of
which he juggled.</p>

<p>She seemed to show more interest
in the radar screen, the navigational
equipment, and the communications
system. About these, she milked
Grant's available knowledge until
he felt like reaching down and
throwing open the reactor valve and
fuel switch.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, if you don't mind,
my back is paralyzed. Let's go back
to the club and I'll answer anything
you want."</p>

<p>"Just one more," she coaxed.
"This crosshair sight with the little
black circle in the middle. How
does that work again?"</p>

<p>Grant straightened up and carefully
massaged the small of his back.
"It's for precise manual navigation
if you need it. You sit up straight
and sight through it."</p>

<p>"And what do you sight at?"</p>

<p>"A star, of course."</p>

<p>"Put it in the little black circle?"</p>

<p>"An A for you. Then you snap
in Automatic Navigational and
you're in business. Or you can navigate
manually by using Gyroscopic
Navigational if you want."</p>

<p>"I'm ready to get out now."
Bridget lifted her hands where Grant
stood on the platform of the boarding
device.</p>

<p>Back or no back, Grant couldn't
resist the opportunity. He pulled her
by the hands to where she was leaning
out the opened canopy, then he
stooped and grabbed her under the
arms and swung her up. For a
moment her soft hair brushed his
ear, and a light scent from her neck
suggested he keep her pliant form
close to him a little longer than
necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/002.png" width="450" height="360" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>He planted her next to the steps,
and she muttered an uninspired
thank you. But halfway down, she
halted and turned.</p>

<p>"It's much easier asking me out
dancing, Grant," she smiled impishly,
and clacked across the hangar
floor toward the jeep.</p>

<hr />

<p>By the next morning arrangements
for a small staff and office space had
swiftly gone through. Working
through lunch, Bridget had the office
set up and the staff briefed and
researching when Grant returned
from dining with the general.</p>

<p>"You're just in time," she said,
looking up from an already cluttered
desk. "I'm ready now to scan
through any G-2 you have on atomjet
operation in your Mojave files."</p>

<p>Grant bristled. "These files are
under the general's nose, and I don't
think he'd appreciate&mdash;" He broke
off when he observed Bridget tapping
her pencil and frowning at him
impatiently.</p>

<p>With a degree of diplomacy he
had to admire, Grant lifted the non-technical
files from the general's office
and furtively smuggled them out
in his brief case.</p>

<p>"Don't take all day," he warned,
handing them to Bridget. "Part of
my job is keeping the general neutral
about you, and not against."</p>

<p>Bridget jumped up and drew another
chair up to her desk. "How
about scanning with me? That'll get
the files back faster. Here, take these
on pilot training."</p>

<p>The files repulsed him less than
Bridget attracted him, and he sat
down promptly. "And what do I
look for, psychologically significant
portions, is that it?"</p>

<p>"Even psychologically insignificant
portions, major, if you please."</p>

<p>Grant began to read. As he scanned
the copies of directives, reports,
operations logs, and procedures the
process became automatic, and part
of his consciousness turned contemplative.</p>

<p>Three months ago he would have
considered the situation in which he
now found himself a future development
out of the question. Mojave
had brimmed with optimism and
pride and accomplishment and eagerness.
Base Mojave loomed vital in
national defense, constituted a main
element of national scientific pride.</p>

<p>From the dusty desert stretches
the sprawling, efficient base had
taken shape while United Nuclear
had yet to assemble an atomjet. The
schedules came out perfectly, and
the first single-manned fusion-propulsed
rocketplane thundered off the
corporation proving grounds and
glided into Base Mojave as planned.
Designed for patrol of the mesosphere,
the ships were to have gained
for the West control of near-Earth
space, besides affording superior observation
posts for Eastern developments
and activity of a space nature.</p>

<p>Training of the pilots had lasted
thirty weeks and went by without
a casualty or serious damage. Testing
and re-testing of the electronics
brought out no flaws. Stress and
thermal analyses held up under all
conditions imposed.</p>

<p>The losses began after the third
week of patrol. UNR-6 failed to
return to base&mdash;with no hint of the
cause, with no communication from
the pilot. That one was hushed up
by the base PR officer, but news of
the second reached the press. During
the fifth week, UNR-2 never returned
for its glide-in, and, of course,
the first loss came out at that time,
too.</p>

<p>General Morrison worked with
the pilots and engineers steadily on
the problem with apparent good results&mdash;for
a month. Then UNR-9
vanished.</p>

<p>Lately the orders had been for
patrol over the States, and it was presumed
UNR-9 would have made an
appearance somewhere had it been
in trouble. That's why the Dakota
farmer's report had been investigated
so swiftly.</p>

<p>As of now, the situation had become
one patrol a day with reluctant
pilots, Congress sending a committee
to the base, a taxpayers' injunction
against the Air Force rocketplane
operation, and United Nuclear
men experimenting hourly with robot-piloted
atomjets at all altitudes
below four hundred miles.</p>

<p>Plus the syk research, naturally.</p>

<p>Bridget's ash tray spilled over with
right-angled cigarette butts, half-burned.
Grant studied her as she read
through the files intently although
her eyes rolled his way briefly on
occasion. She faced him with an
unexpected snap of the head.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Just looking," Grant explained.</p>

<p>"Then just look for a pilot's
manual. It's been mentioned and I
haven't seen one around. Would you
mind?"</p>

<p>Grant opened his mouth to inform
her a pilot's manual for the
atomjet was classified secret, but
caught himself before he could verbalize
the protest. He shrugged and
planned more strategy for invading
the general's files.</p>

<p>The only things he could be
grateful for so far were Bridget's
beauty and the fact the staff had not
realized he was her adjutant.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Mayo psychiatrist and the
Yale psychologist had been in conference
with Bridget for almost an
hour. She had been giving them
preliminary findings and the results
of tests and interviews with the base
pilots.</p>

<p>When they finally broke up, Bridget
approached Grant with a there's-something-I-want-from-you
look.
Grant nearly had a chance to offer
lunch before she suggested it.</p>

<p>What she wanted from him came
out over their aerated sherbet pie.
By the time she finished, Grant's
dessert was beginning to taste like
vitaminized space rations.</p>

<p>"Impossible," he said, dabbing at
sherbet spots on his trousers. "The
general would react faster than to a
red alert."</p>

<p>"Your concern may be the general's
reactions, but mine's not,"
Bridget snapped. "I just want an
objective engineering answer, yes or
no."</p>

<p>Grant threw up his hands. "O.K.,
O.K. With a live pilot, yes, you
can get a TV transmitter in an atomjet
with some doing. You'd have to
jerk out the extra oxygen space
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wonderful! When can you have
it for me?"</p>

<p>"Bridget, what I'm getting at, the
general will take this as a slap at him
and his pilots. We've had TV transmission
from robotized atomjets
dozens of times&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With no results."</p>

<p>"With no results," Grant admitted,
"but that doesn't mean that with
a pilot you'll necessarily get any,
either."</p>

<p>"No, but why hasn't someone
tried?" Bridget waited for him to
answer a decent two seconds and
then added, "The general, naturally."</p>

<p>They left the base lunchroom in
silence, Bridget pouting a lip-edge
more than Grant. Before entering
the office, Grant brought up a rebuttal.</p>

<p>"Another thing, no pilot is going
to push up under those conditions,
with you down there hoping something
will happen."</p>

<p>Bridget had her hand on the door,
but instead of opening it, paused.
"The pilot would have to trust me."
Her eyes darkened, widened, split
Grant emotionally down the middle.
He could understand, for an instant
when he let himself, how a man
could be inveigled to do anything
for a woman.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he said. "A pilot like
that might be hard to find. I'll see
what I can do."</p>

<p>As he walked toward the hangars,
he heard the office door close softly
behind him.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the engineering conference
after supper Grant had never seen
General Morrison looking quite that
old. The man was sustaining an
overload of responsibility, and probably
self-imposed guilt on top of it.</p>

<p>The mechanical engineers made
their report, followed by the electronic
engineers, followed by the
physicist&mdash;all negative. But each
group had a suspicion that another
had overlooked something. Before
it regressed to a high-school debate,
the general bellowed the conference
to order.</p>

<p>Grant was surprised at the twinge
of emotion he experienced when he
realized the general was not going
to ask for a report from syk. Why
should Grant care, anyway? The
position meant nothing to him, Syk
Co&ouml;rdinator.</p>

<p>It meant something to Bridget,
though.</p>

<p>That General Morrison had not
even checked for syk findings annoyed
Grant, perhaps. Under the circumstances
he was justified: nothing
had yet come out, nothing that Bridget
had told Grant, anyway. The
general could not be aware of this.
He assumed it. Maybe that's what
upset Grant.</p>

<p>"Then there's this De-Meteor,"
the general was saying. "I've always
been suspicious of that gadget."</p>

<p>An electronics man spoke up. "A
Clary man checked them all, even
used instrument flight to be certain.
I was with him and counter-checked
the radar high-speed scanners, the
computers, and the course-alteration
mechanism. I was convinced myself
it would steer the ship out of any
situation involving the approach of
one or two penetrating meteors."</p>

<hr />

<p>General Morrison turned to the
spatialogist. "What about the incidence
of penetrating meteors in the
mesosphere?"</p>

<p>"In average fall," the man replied,
"fairly low."</p>

<p>"And the probability of encountering
three at once along a given
atomjet trajectory?"</p>

<p>"From what limited experiments
we have made, the odds would be
astronomical, I'd say."</p>

<p>The general snorted. "Too great
to account for three ships, anyway,
is that it?" He soothed his forehead
with his big hand. "All right, let's
make another check starting tomorrow
morning. More robot-flight tests.
Let's have ships outside the mesosphere
operation range. And I want
reports on anything that looks like
anything, understand?"</p>

<p>The group emitted a low groan.
This was the fourth comprehensive
check&mdash;grueling, close, meticulous,
nerve-racking work.</p>

<p>From the rear came the voice of
a courageous civilian mechanical engineer,
"What about a check on the
pilots?"</p>

<p>The sudden silence was like an
electrical field. The base commander
continued to shuffle up his notes
and papers, but his neck crimsoned.</p>

<p>He's not going to hear it, Grant
thought.</p>

<p>"Conference dismissed!" the general
ordered.</p>

<hr />

<p>Three-four-five rings, and Bridget
answered. The first word was a yawned
"Lieutenant" and the next was
an exhaled "Ashley."</p>

<p>"Sorry to get you up, Bridget.
This is Grant. Can you come down
to Hangar Four?"</p>

<p>"What time is it?" she asked
thickly.</p>

<p>"Three-fifteen. Will you come
down here?"</p>

<p>"Unchaperoned?"</p>

<p>"That's not the point. A surprise.
What we talked about the other
day."</p>

<p>Bridget's interest picked up.
"What we talked about? But I'll
have to dress and fix my face&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put on a robe and slippers. It's
a warm morning. I've got it fixed
with the O.D. Now, will you come
on down?"</p>

<p>She paused. "You've convinced
me."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Grant heard her
slippers shuffling over the concrete.
She arrived in a brilliant blue nylon
robe, with white fluffy slippers and
traces of a lighter blue nightgown
underneath. The hangar brightness
brought a frown to her eyes, which
she shielded with a hand cupped to
her brow. A creature as entrancing
as that, Grant decided, should now
recite prose poetry in contralto tones
to make his ideal complete.</p>

<p>"Well?" she croaked, a sleepy
frog in her throat. "So I'm here."</p>

<p>The last mechanic was picking up
his tools and was about ready to
leave. Otherwise, they were alone,
except for the guard at the hangar
entrance.</p>

<p>"Up on the platform," said Grant,
unlocking the canopy of UNR-12.
He busied himself adjusting the
guiding tension.</p>

<p>He heard the slippers, shuffling
and gritting, climb the loading device
and stop next to him. He heard
the gasp as she saw the pilot compartment's
freshly built-in TV transmitter
and lens. When he felt the
pull on his arm, he chose to notice
her.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Grant. I thought for a
while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's ready for tomorrow if you
want it," Grant mentioned casually.</p>

<p>Bridget's fists clenched and her
eyes brightened. "Wow," she observed.
"Then you've got a pilot?"</p>

<p>Grinning sourly, Grant said, "As
if you don't know who."</p>

<p>Her eyes showed concern. "What
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean things have worked out
creamy as you planned."</p>

<p>"Grant, I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Now, don't tell me you didn't
know I could push up one of these
things." He patted the side of the
atomjet.</p>

<p>"You, a pilot? Grant. I didn't
know."</p>

<p>"Let's say it's been convenient for
you, anyway."</p>

<hr />

<p>They had walked outside, Bridget
trying to find Grant's gaze, which
he put onto a distant ridge of hills
rising dimly against the desert starscape.</p>

<p>Bridget said seriously, "You think
I've been enticing you into the pilot
job, is that it?"</p>

<p>Grant's glance fell to hers. "It
looked that way to me. All the
general's staff have to fly 'em, I
thought you knew that. I don't
patrol, of course."</p>

<p>They neared her quarters, and
the shadow of the building that
spilled over them was deep.</p>

<p>"I didn't know, Grant, believe
me." Her voice carried earnestness.</p>

<p>"You don't have to prove it,"
Grant said huskily.</p>

<p>He had caught her hand, and
then her arm slid softly around his
neck. Her kiss was meant as brief,
but he persuaded her differently.
They clung together silently until
the barracks guard had spun an
about-face and headed back their
way.</p>

<p>"Please, Grant, get someone else
to go up," she whispered.</p>

<p>"You said you wanted a pilot
who trusted you," reminded Grant.
"Now, get to bed before I gig you
for being out of uniform. See me
tomorrow on TV."</p>

<hr />

<p>The miles altimeter needle swept
steadily and was about to pass the
300 division. Star-sprinkled space-darkness
lay ahead by now, but when
he looked to the side the Earth's
surface reflected the sunlight dazzlingly.</p>

<p>It wasn't that he felt self-consciousness
over the lens in front of
him, or over the one showing him
in profile, and the one just over his
shoulder viewing the instrument
panel. Nor was it based on his not
pushing up in over a month. He
traced it probably to the uncertainty
of his position.</p>

<p>His position was uncertain, because
Bridget could easily be right.
Actually, considering the lack of one
lead in the other avenues of the
investigation, chances were good
something was happening to pilots
and could happen to him.</p>

<p>That was not what bothered him:
not that something might occur, but
<i>what</i> might occur. Fighting unknowns
for Grant carried no interest.</p>

<p>"I'm over 300," he transmitted.
"Now what?"</p>

<p>Bridget's voice arrived with an
ionospheric waver. "Level at 375.
Please remember, you're trying to
simulate patrol conditions. Don't
transmit unless it's your report period
or something goes wrong."</p>

<p>"Like what, lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"If you knew all the psychological
quirks possible, you'd avoid them,
major. And if you're still worried,
I've taken adequate precautions.
There's a staff of twenty-five persons
here with instruments on you. By the
way, your picture is coming over
horribly."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/003.png" width="450" height="316" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>"Try my profile. I've heard it's
better."</p>

<p>"And please replace your galvanometric
and respiratory clamps. We're
getting no register here."</p>

<p>"They're too uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Major, let me remind you this
flight is costing the taxpayers plenty,
hasn't General Morrison's clearance,
and may have to be flown again unless
you co&ouml;perate fully." Grant
smiled at the lens. He could visualize
her curls whipping around.</p>

<p>"Now, please co&ouml;perate and replace
the clamps, and try to simulate
patrol conditions. I will call you from
time to time for further instructions.
Ashley at Mojave&mdash;out."</p>

<p>Grant returned, "Reis over Mojave&mdash;nuts."</p>

<p>After parodying annoyance at the
lens, he dutifully replaced the chest
and palm clamps and settled down
to the tedium of patrol.</p>

<hr />

<p>Behind him, tons of pressure thundered
silently out in controlled gaseous
fusion, hurled him starward on
a pillar of energy. He had already
broken his vertical ascent and was
slanting toward the latitude Bridget
requested. The Pacific rolled up
under the atomjet's polished nose,
which sparkled with myriads of
brighter star reflections. Then he
recalled he couldn't play over the
ocean and veered slowly northward,
up the coast to the telltale configuration
of Puget Sound.</p>

<p>Over the eastern lakes he cut
fusion and watched on the altimeter
dial the battle between gravity and
inertia. Near the Mississippi delta he
was wrenched in a sharp maneuver
as the De-Meteor suddenly took
over. He was fortunate to see the
streaking missile glow brightly and
flare out of existence in the thin
regions of atmosphere miles beneath
him.</p>

<p>More than three hours of patrol,
and no word from Mojave. Obediently,
Grant had not called in. He
set course for Mojave and was nearly
ready to transmit when a bark of
static filled the pressurized control
bubble. Disappointed, Grant heard
a male voice over the speaker.</p>

<p>"High altitude weather observation
overdue. UNR-12, please report
synoptics in quadrants."</p>

<p>They really want simulation, Grant
grumbled mentally. "Southwest
quadrant, southeast quadrant clear
except for banner-clouding higher
ranges. Northwest, scattered alto-cumulus,
looks like the onset of a
warm front, with the northeast quadrant
moderate-high cirrus. And let
me talk to Br ... to Lieutenant
Ashley, please."</p>

<p>A pause. "Ashley, Mojave."</p>

<p>"How's my picture now?"</p>

<p>"Your vertical is off, and you
flutter. Major, the first three hours
have been without direction from the
base. For the next two, we're going
to ask you to perform certain patrol
tasks, perhaps repeat them. The
process may not prove especially
enjoyable. Your close co&ouml;peration
will be appreciated."</p>

<p>"If this is all stuff we went
through in training&mdash;" Grant sputtered.</p>

<p>"Some of it may be," Bridget's
voice. "The fact it's distasteful may
make it the more significant. Are you
ready to co&ouml;perate?"</p>

<p>Grant nodded at the lens and
screwed up his face in an exaggerated
frown.</p>

<p>Bridget's thoroughness called for
admiration. She had him at the end
of a string, activating him from a
plot taken directly from the pilot's
manual. He would co&ouml;perate, but he
was not enthusiastic.</p>

<p>As the exercises progressed, Grant
detected subtle variations Bridget
had added to the basic maneuvers.
On the tight starboard circle, for
instance, she had him keep his eyes
on Earth, making him slightly dizzy.</p>

<p>Then she requested a free-fall
drop from a stall with the provision
he this time place his attention on
the instrument panel&mdash;"with no
peeking outside." He complied,
watching the altimeter trace forty
miles toward the basement, and
experienced effects no different than
usual.</p>

<p>After a while, he came to consider
it a game and might have gained
amusement from it, were it not for
the tiredness creeping in behind his
eyes and the fact two dozen technicians
somewhere down there were
hoping to trip a fatal, hidden
synapse.</p>

<p>"How much more of this?" Grant
transmitted finally.</p>

<p>"Getting tired?" Bridget replied,
and paused for an answer.</p>

<p>"Let's say I don't feel like six sets
of tennis."</p>

<p>"A few more, major, and we'll
authorize your glide-in." If there
was disappointment in her voice, it
did not manifest itself. "Your next
exercise is manual navigation with
Jupiter as your fix."</p>

<hr />

<p>Grant took down the figures she
gave in acute disinterest. Boredom
had settled heavily over his outlook
on the operation. No longer did it
matter that his facial reactions were
being televised to the syk-happy
probers; and it made no difference
to him any more that his every
breath, swallow, heart beat, tension,
and sweat-secretion was magnified
by inky needles along moving rolls
of paper.</p>

<p>His exercise target was a southwestern
New Mexico town, and he
swung back from the Gulf area and
coaxed the responsive craft until the
planet gleamed brightly in the crosshairs
of the navigational sight. That
put him four degrees off the horizontal,
he noted, but Jupiter was
setting; he adjusted his velocity to
maintain the planet's relative skyward
position in the west.</p>

<p>In some irritation he stepped up
the thrust. This one could easily take
too long. The faint hum of the
power plant provided music as the
bright point of light danced slightly
from the sight's center.</p>

<p>The realization came that he had
jumped convulsively. Grant was puzzled
that he was not aware what
had happened. Some sort of reflex?
But reflex from what? Tingling
coursed its way up his left leg and
he rubbed his thigh.</p>

<p>When he put his attention on the
sight again, the planet had slipped
out. In fact, it was nowhere in the
immediate starscape ahead of him.</p>

<p>His quick glance at the basement
showed first that a twilight shadow
was moving in from the north&mdash; From
the north? It had to be the
east! And how come so soon?</p>

<hr />

<p>Small panic twisted his diaphragm
when he viewed below the unfamiliar
topography and increasing cloudiness.
And when he saw by his watch
it was nearly three&mdash;</p>

<p>The radio had started to transmit.
He swallowed a lump of fear and
prepared some kind of an answer.
"... If you hear me. Please indicate
if you hear me, Grant."</p>

<p>He nodded at the lens.</p>

<p>"Would you like a pilot to help
you orient from here?"</p>

<p>Grant felt sheepish, but the panic
still remained. He was now aware
his alertness was not up to par, so
he nodded again. But he was feeling
better by the minute.</p>

<p>Back on course under one of the
pilot's directions, Grant soon took
over.</p>

<p>"Skip that exercise, Grant, and
glide in," Bridget sent. "Feel up to
it, now?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but what's it all about?
I must've passed out, but damned
if I know what for."</p>

<p>Grant heard Bridget's laugh and
his morale improved. "You come
down and take me to dinner and
I'll give you the answer&mdash;and what
I think may be the answer to all
the general's troubles. Right now I've
got a report to write so the general
can get the word soon&mdash;and as painlessly
as possible."</p>

<p>Grant pressed the stud to activate
the skin coolant system for entrance
into the atmosphere. He almost felt
like grinning.</p>

<hr />

<p>Grant at the medical officer's advice
took a brief nap, which quickly
cleared up his mental fuzziness. As
a surprise to Bridget he ordered a
rotocab from Barstow, the nearest
town, booming since the base had
become operative.</p>

<p>In a specialty restaurant over
freshly arrived seafood from San
Francisco, Grant tried to persuade
Bridget to stop teasing him about
the navigational foul-up and set him
straight. He had put up with it as
long as he did only because she had
worn an off-shoulder yellow gown,
snugly fitted, that made the uniform
seem like the design of a Mid-Victorian
prude.</p>

<p>Grant, exasperated, brought her
teasing up short. "I've been priding
myself on keeping up the myth I'm a
wide-awake young man and pilot.
Never have I passed out before&mdash;never.
I feel like a washed-out cadet.
You've had your fun baiting&mdash;now,
what made me blank?"</p>

<p>Bridget cringed as he tore a slice
of French bread in half with one
hostile, meaningful bite.</p>

<p>She waved her cigarette haughtily.
"We in psychology have found certain
stimuli productive of consistent
human response. Especially true in
tactile sensation, this, however, is
not as true in the auditory and
visual."</p>

<p>"You're being technical," Grant
interrupted. "Just let me know
simple-like, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Consequently," she continued,
"the problem presented to the investigating
psychologist was one of
seeking an involuntary response to
one or more stimuli, in sequence or
grouped. Traditionally&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Ashley&mdash;" Grant held up
the small, square tissue-wrapped box,
tied with a bow&mdash;"I would like to
have you open this tonight, but obviously
you're not going to have time
what with the thesis, and all." He
deliberately put the box back in his
coat pocket.</p>

<p>Their eyes held over her swordfish
momentarily.</p>

<p>"So, O.K., I looked around for
nasty stimuli, that's all," Bridget
went on. "There were lots of possibilities,
but I sorta picked two or
three. Part of our pilot interviews
was for getting descriptions from
the men on what the conditions up
there felt like, sounded like, looked
like, smelled like, and so on. Completely
individual, mind you. From
that we spotted negative elements
held in common by them."</p>

<p>Grant reached for her arm and
blocked the upward motion of her
fish-loaded fork.</p>

<p>"You can eat after," he said.</p>

<p>"I threw the nasty ones at you
when you began tiring, because that's
when the body's stimulus-response
setup starts pulling away from conscious
direction. I saved the one I
had the hunch on for the last."</p>

<p>"The navigation exercise, you
mean? I still don't get what that
has to do with my leg cramp."</p>

<p>Bridget laughed. "Oh, that. One
of those leads attached to your leg
carried a little voltage&mdash;just in case
you passed out. The benefits of
current psychology, you know."</p>

<hr />

<p>Grant repressed a smile. "Thanks
for letting me know what brought
me around, but you are still stalling
about why I went under."</p>

<p>"You figure it out. What were the
stimuli associated with the manual
navigation problem?"</p>

<p>"Let's see," he mused. "Tactile:
nothing important, just the control
levers. Visually, the star field and
Jupiter and the crosshairs. Auditorily,
the power hum&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What stands out?"</p>

<p>"The planet and the hum, I
guess."</p>

<p>"And how did the planet appear?"
Bridget asked.</p>

<p>"A point of light, you mean?"</p>

<p>"And what does that add up to:
a bright concentrated light source
on which you fix your attention and
a monotonous hum?"</p>

<p>"Not hypnotism!"</p>

<p>Bridget shrugged. "A reasonable
facsimile. Especially when you throw
mental fatigue in with it."</p>

<p>"But you need a suggestion, I
thought&mdash;" Grant was amazed.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," she replied.
"You were mentally tired, there was
some self-suggestion for sleep. But
simply a continued fixation of the
eyes in suggestive subjects can be
enough. There may be a subconscious
association with previous hypnosis, or
early states of mental shock. In the
highly suggestive, a steady lulling
noise can be sufficient in itself. And
you were alone, with no one around
to snap a finger under your nose.
Add it up in your situation, and you
blank out."</p>

<p>Grant slapped his forehead.
"What did I look like?"</p>

<p>"Not any different than usual,"
she said, laughing. "You continued
to hold the controls, but you stared
vacantly and tensed quite a bit. Well,
we have the complete recording on
your reactions if you want to check.
Naturally, you pulled off course,
ended up over Mexico, gaining about
fifty miles in altitude."</p>

<p>The others, thought Grant, rode
until their oxygen gave out or dived
through the atmosphere without skin-cooling,
or came out of it too late
and found&mdash; He decided not to
think about it.</p>

<p>"But I don't think I'm hypnotic,"
Grant protested.</p>

<p>"Everyone is hypnotic to a degree.
Some are a great deal more than
others, and these are the ones that
are apparent. Impose the right conditions
and a quasi-hypnotic condition
could be affected on most anyone."</p>

<p>"But why hasn't this happened
elsewhere?"</p>

<p>Bridget took a quick bite of fish
before he could stop her. "It has.
First documentation I found was in
the South Pacific air war in the '40s.
One-man escorting fighter planes in
several cases slipped out of bomber
formations they were following at
night and splashed. One of the
explanations at their hearings, but
never investigated thoroughly, was
hypnosis from the single red taillight
of the bombers. In one outfit, the
losses stopped when the fighters flew
up front."</p>

<p>"Not only sharp, but good-looking,
too," Grant admired, and began
chewing on the other half of his
French bread. Then he ceased masticating
and mouthed anxiously,
"You've told the general this?"</p>

<p>Bridget clapped her hands. "With
exquisite pleasure."</p>

<p>"And he&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"... Got excited, phoned for
engineering to remove navigational
sights and suggested I join the staff
at the base."</p>

<p>Grant coughed on the bread and
hurriedly reached for his water. "He
wants you around?"</p>

<p>"Gratitude, I guess, in his own
brassy way."</p>

<p>"And you'll stay?"</p>

<p>"If Washington O.K.'s it, and
I'm coaxed."</p>

<p>"Then that simplifies the matter,"
he said and brought out the daintily
wrapped tiny gift box. "For you."</p>

<p>Her eyes warmed and smiled as
she said, "That's the kind of coaxing
a woman wants."</p>

<p>Grant fumed, "Then you know
what it is? Extrasensory perception
or something psychological?"</p>

<p>Their hands met across the table
and lingered.</p>

<p>"Purely an emotional response,"
said Bridget.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
